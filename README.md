# Hello world!

### About me

My name is Vinicius, I'm 20 years old. I like programming. During the day, I dedicate my time to working as a programmer, where I use my skills to create innovative solutions. At night, I study Systems Development Analysis at college, aiming to further improve my knowledge.

On the weekends, I like to focus on personal growth and I'm always looking to learn something new. I take this time to study new programming languages, explore software development frameworks and solve exciting challenges because I understand that continuous learning is crucial for my professional growth.

In addition, I try to balance my leisure time with moments of relaxation. I love playing video games as it not only provides entertainment but also helps me control my mind by solving problems and thinking strategically. Watching movies and TV series is also part of my leisure activities, offering a welcome break and an opportunity to immerse myself in engaging stories.

Overall, I am a dedicated person, passionate about technology and always striving to become the best version of myself. I believe that with effort, perseverance and love for what I do, I can achieve great things both in my career and in my personal life. I am excited about the future and the opportunities that lie ahead and I am ready to face challenges with enthusiasm and competence.
